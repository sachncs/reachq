"""Shortest-path algorithms for weighted digraphs.

Implements Dijkstra, A* search (with optional reopen and consistency
validation), truncated SSSP, and the hop-bounded SSSP primitive
used by the hopset construction (Theorem 4).

Heap-tie correctness: every heap entry includes a per-call
monotonic counter, so ties never compare vertex objects. This
allows arbitrarily-hashable vertex keys (``object()``,
``frozenset``, custom classes) without ``TypeError``.

The hop-bounded query ``shortest_path_hopbound`` implements the
layered dynamic programming required by Theorem 4: each
(vertex, hops_used) pair carries its own best distance, so a
costlier arrival that uses fewer hops is preserved when the
unused hops may still be needed to reach a target within
``max_hops``.

Unreachable vertices are *absent* from the returned mapping. For
``shortest_path`` use the constant ``UNREACHABLE`` as a sentinel
for an unreachable target.
