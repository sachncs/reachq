"""Reachability over hypergraphs.

A hypergraph generalises a directed graph: instead of edges
connecting exactly two vertices, a *hyperedge* connects an arbitrary
non-empty subset of vertices. Formally, a directed hypergraph is a
pair ``(V, E)`` where ``E`` is a set of pairs ``(S, T)`` with
``S, T ⊆ V``, ``S ≠ ∅``, and ``T ≠ ∅``.

A vertex ``v`` is reachable from a source ``s`` iff there is a
sequence of hyperedges ``(S_1, T_1), ..., (S_k, T_k)`` such that:

- ``s ∈ S_1`` (or ``s = s`` trivially)
- for each step, ``T_i ∩ S_{i+1} ≠ ∅`` (a "link" vertex)
- ``v ∈ T_k`` (or any downstream vertex)

Hypergraph reachability generalises standard graph reachability
because ordinary directed edges are exactly the case where
``|S| = |T| = 1``.

**Complexity:** BFS over a directed hypergraph with n vertices and
m hyperedges, each of average size k, costs O(m * k) per source.
For arbitrary k, this is O(m * n) in the worst case.

Reference: Ausiello, Franciosa, Italiano, "Dynamic transitive
closure for directed hypergraphs." (2004). Our implementation is a
straightforward BFS; the dynamic update problem is much harder and
is not addressed here.
