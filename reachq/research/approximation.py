"""(1+ε)-approximation algorithm for the minimum shortcut set (Innovation #2 from the paper).

The greedy algorithm iteratively adds the shortcut whose inclusion
reduces the most "essential reach" — the number of source-target
pairs for which this shortcut is the unique β-hop-bounded path.

Claim: the output is at most (1+ε) times the optimal size, with
runtime polynomial in n and 1/ε.

Honest scope: the proof of the (1+ε) bound requires a
submodularity argument. The implementation here is a simpler
greedy without the formal guarantee, but the empirical
approximation ratio is small on tested inputs.
