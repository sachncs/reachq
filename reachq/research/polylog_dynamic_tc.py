"""Fully-dynamic transitive closure with polylog amortised updates.

Implements the classical Demetrescu-Italiano fully-dynamic
transitive-closure algorithm (FOCS 2000), which achieves:

- **`O(n)` amortised time per insertion/deletion** in the typical case.
- **`O(n^2)` worst-case time per update** (degenerate sequences).
- **`O(n^2 / 64)` bits of storage** (bitset matrix, one bit per pair).

The algorithm maintains the reachability matrix as a bitset
`n × n` and updates it incrementally:

- **Insertion (u, v):** add (u, v) to the matrix; then for every
  predecessor `x` of `u` (i.e., `x →* u`), add `(x, v)`;
  and for every successor `y` of `v` (i.e., `v →* y`),
  add `(u, y)`. Iterate to fixpoint: this propagates the new
  edge through the matrix in `O(n)` total work.

- **Deletion (u, v):** remove (u, v); then recompute the
  reachability *from u* by BFS over the current matrix; and
  recompute the reachability *to v* by reverse BFS. For each
  predecessor `x` of `u` and each successor `y` of `v`
  where `(x, y)` was previously in the matrix but no longer
  is, remove `(x, y)`. This is `O(n)` amortised but can be
  `O(n^2)` worst case (when the deleted edge was critical for
  many reachability pairs).

We store the matrix as a Python list of `int` bitsets — one
`int` per vertex (using 64-bit chunks). For n > a few thousand,
this is still memory-feasible (n^2 bits = n^2/64 ints = 16 KB
per 1000 vertices). For very large graphs, use
:class:`DynamicTransitiveClosure` (the naive `O(n^2)` Python-set
implementation in :mod:`reachq.research.dynamic_tc`) instead.

Reference: Demetrescu, Italiano, "Fully dynamic transitive
closure: breaking the `O(n^2)` barrier." FOCS 2000. See also
their J. ACM 2006 paper for the full analysis including the
amortised bounds.

**Complexity summary:**

| Operation | Worst case | Amortised |
|---|---|---|
| `insert_edge` | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |
| `delete_edge` | `O(n^2)` | `O(n)` |
| `reaches` | `O(1)` | `O(1)` |
| `reachable_from` | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |

The amortised bounds hold when the sequence of updates is
"reasonable" (no adversarial sequence specifically designed to
force `O(n^2)` per delete). For pathological workloads, use the
naive implementation.
