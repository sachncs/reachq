"""Research-only algorithms not covered by the cited papers.

Modules in this subpackage are explicitly marked ``__experimental__``
at the module level. They are not part of the reachq versioning
contract; they may change without a major-version bump.

**Stable boundary**: any code under :mod:`reachq.shortcut`,
:mod:`reachq.hopset`, :mod:`reachq.reachability`, :mod:`reachq.graph`,
:mod:`reachq.closure`, or :mod:`reachq.config` may import from
:mod:`reachq.research` only via the symbols re-exported here, and
only behind an explicit experimental flag. Production callers should
treat the public surface here as best-effort.

**Importing from production code**: importing anything from
:mod:`reachq.research` inside the core modules is unsupported.
Doing so means accepting breakage on any release.
