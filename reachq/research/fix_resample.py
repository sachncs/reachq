"""Fix/Resample variant of shortcut-set construction.

Inspired by Assadi-Yazdanyar's dynamic graph coloring algorithm
(arXiv:2604.20648). Their algorithm maintains a partial coloring
under dynamic updates via local Fix/Resample subroutines; we adapt the
*static* version (no updates, just a local-search refiner) as an
experimental alternative to the JLS sampling approach.

Honest scope: Paper 1's algorithm targets the *dynamic* setting where
the graph changes between updates. Our codebase is purely *static*, so
the dynamic-update bounds do not apply. We implement the static
analogue purely as a comparison point.

Expected empirical outcome: this algorithm produces a *larger*
shortcut set than JLS on the same graph, because the dynamic update
motivates careful local search while the static case has no
incremental cost. We document this honestly in the comparison script.

    """Fix/Resample-style shortcut-set construction (static).

    Algorithm:
      1. Start with empty shortcut set H and F = all vertices (uncovered).
      2. While F is non-empty and iterations remain:
         a. Pick a vertex v in F uniformly at random.
         b. Add v as a pivot: insert (v, w) for w in R+(v) and (w, v)
            for w in R-(v).
         c. Remove v and newly-reached vertices from F.
         d. With probability resample_prob, do a "resample": pick a
            random pivot already in H, remove its shortcuts, and
            re-add it (with fresh randomness). This is the analogue of
            Paper 1's Resample subroutine.
      3. Return H.

    Args:
        graph: input digraph (any orientation).
        threshold_fraction: stop when |F| / |V| <= this fraction.
            (Default 0.5 means stop when half the vertices are uncovered.
            Lower values give larger shortcut sets.)
        resample_prob: per-iteration probability of a resample pass.
            (Default 0.05; this is the analogue of Paper 1's
            Resample step.)
        max_iterations: hard cap on iterations to guarantee termination.
        random_seed: optional seed for reproducibility.

    Returns:
        A set of shortcut edges.
