"""beta-hopbound-preserving sparsification (research prototype).

The reachability-only sparsifier in ``reachq.research.sparsify``
removes a shortcut (u, v) whenever v is still reachable from u via
``G + (H \\ {(u, v)})`` without a hop limit. That preserves
reachability but can destroy the beta-hopbound guarantee of the JLS
construction: on a path of n=50 vertices the JLS shortcut set compresses
the diameter from 49 to 2 hops, and the reachability-only sparsifier
removes every shortcut, restoring the long path.

This module provides a sparsifier that only removes a shortcut when the
GLOBAL beta-hopbound is preserved, i.e. every pair (s, t) that is
reachable in G must remain reachable in ``G + (H \\ {(u, v)})`` within
beta hops. The greedy is correct by construction: it never removes a
shortcut whose removal would push any reachable pair above beta.

Honest scope:

* The correctness guarantee holds for every graph, but the per-removal
  check is an all-pairs hop-BFS, so the total cost is
  O(|H| * n * (n + m + |H|)). This is only practical for small graphs;
  the ``max_vertices`` guard refuses to run above a size threshold.
* "Minimality" is NOT claimed. Computing a minimum-size hop-bound
  shortcut set is NP-hard in general; the greedy output is simply a
  sound set with no locally-redundant shortcut (each remaining shortcut
  is essential for the beta-hopbound of at least one pair).
