"""Dynamic transitive closure maintenance.

Maintains the transitive closure of a directed graph under edge
insertions and deletions. This is a *naive* implementation suitable
for correctness verification and small-graph testing; it does not
achieve polylog amortised update time.

**Complexity (honest scope):**

- Insert: `O(n^2)` worst case. After inserting (u, v), every vertex x
  that can reach u now also reaches every vertex in v's reachable
  set (R+(v)), and every vertex y that v reaches can also reach
  every vertex that u reaches. The implementation walks these
  relations explicitly.

- Delete: `O(n^2)` worst case. After deleting (u, v), we recompute
  the affected rows and columns of the reachability matrix by BFS
  from u (for u's forward reachability) and from predecessors of u
  (for their forward reachability through u). The naive approach
  is to recompute the full matrix in O(n * (n + m)) work.

For fully-dynamic transitive closure with polylog update time, see
Demetrescu-Italiano (FOCS 2000) and subsequent work. That algorithm
is materially more complex than the naive approach and is not
included here.

This module's purpose is to give users a working, correct
implementation for small to medium graphs (n < ~10k) and to serve
as a baseline against which any future optimized implementation can
be benchmarked.
