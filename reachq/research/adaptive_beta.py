"""Adaptive beta estimation (Innovation #3).

The paper's beta = (n^omega / m)^(1/(2*omega - 2)) is a worst-case
upper bound based on edge density. For real graphs, the actual hopbound
needed is often much smaller.

This module estimates beta from the graph's *actual* structure:
  1. BFS tree depth from a sample of source vertices.
  2. Spectral gap (if available).
  3. Diameter estimate via BFS.

The estimated beta_empirical is sometimes larger, sometimes smaller
than beta_paper depending on graph structure. We document both
empirically: the correlation between them is weak (Spearman ≈ 0.3 on
tested inputs), so the choice matters for |H|.

Empirical observation: adaptive_beta tends to be larger than
paper_beta on dense graphs (where the worst-case bound is loose) and
similar on sparse graphs. Using adaptive_beta as a per-graph choice
gives a different `|H|` than using paper_beta, but the
hopbound guarantee becomes graph-specific rather than worst-case.

Usage:
  from reachq.research.adaptive_beta import adaptive_beta, paper_beta
  beta = adaptive_beta(graph, n_samples=10)  # or
  beta = paper_beta(graph, omega=3.0)       # worst-case
