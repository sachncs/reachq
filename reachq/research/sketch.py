"""HyperLogLog-style approximate reachability.

Estimates the cardinality of a vertex's reachable set using
HyperLogLog sketching. This is much smaller than storing the full
reachability set (O(1) vs O(n) per vertex) and supports fast
cardinality queries.

**Algorithm (HyperLogLog, Flajolet et al. 2007):**

1. Hash every vertex to a binary string.
2. Split each hash into a high-order "register index" of ``p`` bits
   and a low-order "tail" of length ``rho``.
3. For each hash, find the position of the leftmost 1-bit in the
   tail and store the maximum position in the register indexed by
   the register index.
4. Estimate the cardinality as ``alpha_p * m * 2^(-mean(rho))``,
   where ``m = 2^p`` is the number of registers and ``alpha_p``
   is a bias-correction constant.

**Standard error:** approximately ``1.04 / sqrt(m)`` for the default
precision p = 14 (m = 16384 registers).

**Reachability sketch:**

The reachable set is approximated by sketching each vertex that is
reached during BFS. The estimate is the cardinality of the union,
which is exactly what HyperLogLog computes without explicit set
union. The estimate is approximate but:

- Never overestimates by more than a small factor in practice.
- Never underestimates by more than ``3 * standard_error``.
- Supports merging two sketches in O(m) time (union of reachability
  sets).

This is the standard HyperLogLog algorithm; novelty is its
application to reachability counting.
