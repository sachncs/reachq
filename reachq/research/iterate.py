"""Shortcut set iterative refinement (Innovation #2).

After the JLS construction produces H_0, iteratively refine:

    H_{k+1} = jls_with_tc_pruning(G ∪ H_k, ...)

Each iteration re-runs the JLS construction on the augmented graph
G ∪ H_k. The intuition: shortcuts in H_k expand reachability, so the
construction on G ∪ H_k produces *fewer* needed shortcuts (since some
queries are now satisfied by H_k rather than requiring a new pivot).

Robust core: we return H_1 ∩ H_2 ∩ ... (the intersection of all
iterations), which is the set of shortcuts that *every* iteration of
the construction agrees is needed. Shortcuts that appear in H_1 but
not H_2 are "self-redundant" (JLS added them, but JLS wouldn't
re-add them given H_1 already in the graph).

Soundness: the intersection of sound shortcut sets is sound. Each H_k
satisfies R+(G, s) ⊆ R+(G ∪ H_k, s), so the intersection does too.

Empirical finding:

  On random DAGs (n=60, p=0.1) with parameters matched to
  build_shortcut_set_for_reachability, the construction is IDEMPOTENT:
  |H_2| = |H_1| (the second pass over G ∪ H_1 re-derives the same set).
  The strict reduction reported in earlier versions (|H_1|=670,
  |H_2|=608) came from a hand-rolled second call that used different
  k/rho parameters than the wrapper and relied on a module-global
  sampling constant; it is not reproducible with consistent parameters
  and should not be relied on.

The robust-core semantics still hold: the intersection of sound
shortcut sets is sound, so even when the iteration is idempotent the
returned set is a valid shortcut set. When the intersection becomes
empty, the function returns the empty set rather than the last
iteration's H, matching the contract that the result is the *robust
core* (shortcuts present in every iteration).

    Each iteration: H_{k+1} = jls_with_tc_pruning(G ∪ H_k, ...).
    Uses the same parameter selection as
    ``build_shortcut_set_for_reachability`` so iterations are
    comparable.

    Returns the ROBUST CORE: H_1 ∩ H_2 ∩ ... ∩ H_n, the intersection
    of all iterations. Shortcuts in the intersection are those that
    every iteration of the construction agrees are needed. Shortcuts
    in H_1 \ H_2 are "self-redundant" -- JLS added them but wouldn't
    re-add them given H_1 already in the graph.

    Args:
        graph: The input digraph G.
        omega: Fast-matrix-multiplication exponent (default 3.0).
        max_iterations: Hard cap on iterations.
        random_seed: Optional seed for reproducibility.

    Returns:
        The robust core shortcut set (intersection of all iterations),
        or the empty set if the intersection becomes empty.
