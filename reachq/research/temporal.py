"""Reachability over temporal graphs.

A temporal graph (also called a time-varying graph) is a directed
graph where each edge has an associated timestamp. Reachability is
restricted to edges whose timestamps respect a *temporal walk*:
edges must be traversed in non-decreasing order of timestamp.

Formally, a temporal walk from ``s`` to ``t`` is a sequence of
edges ``(u_0, v_0, tau_0), (u_1, v_1, tau_1), ..., (u_k, v_k, tau_k)``
with ``u_0 = s``, ``v_k = t``, ``v_i = u_{i+1}`` for ``i < k``,
and ``tau_i <= tau_{i+1}`` for all i.

This module implements:

1. :class:`TemporalDigraph` — a digraph with timestamped edges.
2. :func:`temporal_bfs` — BFS that respects temporal ordering.
3. :func:`earliest_arrival` — earliest timestamp at which a target
   becomes reachable from a source.

Temporal reachability is strictly harder than standard reachability
because the temporal walk constraint is monotone in time. For any
fixed source ``s``, the set of vertices reachable at time ``tau`` is
non-decreasing with ``tau``; the "earliest arrival" problem asks for
the minimum ``tau`` at which a target becomes reachable.

Reference: Xuan, Ferreira, Jarry, "Computing shortest, fastest, and
foremost walks in temporal graphs." *J. Comput. System Sci. 69
(2004)*. Our implementation is the classical BFS-based labelling
algorithm (Algorithm 1 in that paper).
