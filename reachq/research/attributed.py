"""Reachability over attributed graphs.

Extends reachability to graphs where vertices and edges carry
attributes. Reachability queries can filter on attribute values:

- **Vertex predicates** restrict which vertices can be visited
- **Edge predicates** restrict which edges can be traversed

A typical use: in a social network, only traverse edges whose
``relationship`` attribute is "friend" or "colleague" (not "blocked").

The implementation adapts the standard BFS from
:mod:`reachq.reachability` with two callback predicates that
gate vertex/edge acceptance. Both predicates default to "always
true" (no filtering).

    """Reachability from ``source`` under attribute constraints.

    Performs a BFS from ``source``, visiting only vertices that
    satisfy ``vertex_pred`` and traversing only edges that satisfy
    ``edge_pred``. Self-loops and unreachable vertices are handled
    naturally.

    Args:
        graph: Input digraph.
        source: Starting vertex. Must be in ``graph``.
        vertex_pred: Optional predicate over vertex objects. If
            provided, vertices for which it returns False are
            excluded from the visited set (and not enqueued).
            Default: visit all vertices.
        edge_pred: Optional predicate over (u, v) pairs. If provided,
            edges for which it returns False are not traversed.
