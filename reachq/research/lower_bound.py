"""Lower bound construction for shortcut-set size (Innovation #4).

The paper's bound is |H| <= `O(m*rho + n*rho^2)`. We construct specific
graph families and measure |H| empirically to characterise when the
bound is tight vs loose.

Construction 1: Complete bipartite path (barbell).
  - Two cliques of size k/2 connected by a path of length k.
  - n = k, m = `O(k^2)`.
  - beta = (n^omega / m)^(1/(2*omega - 2)) = `O(1)` (dense).
  - Bound: |H| <= `O(m*rho + n*rho^2)` = `O(k^2)`.
  - Empirical |H|: the cliques are internally reachable, the path
    bridges the two cliques. Shortcuts needed: `O(k)` for the path
    interior. Total |H| = `O(k)`.

  Insight: bound is `O(k^2)`, empirical is `O(k)` — bound is loose by
  a constant factor on barbell graphs. The bound's `O(n*rho^2)`
  term is loose because TC-pruning fires for very small r_ball on
  these inputs.

Construction 2: Random DAG (baseline).
  - n vertices, density p.
  - Bound: `O(m*rho + n*rho^2)` where rho = sqrt(n)/beta.
  - Empirical: |H| >> bound by a factor of 100-1000 (we have shown
    this in results/summary.md).

Construction 3: Layered DAG.
  - L layers of size s, edges between adjacent layers.
  - n = L*s, m = (L-1)*s^2.
  - beta = (n^omega/m)^(1/(2omega-2)).
  - For L = s: n = s^2, m = (s-1)*s^2 ≈ n*sqrt(n).
  - beta = (n^omega / n^1.5) = n^(omega-1.5) ≈ n^1.5.
  - rho = sqrt(n)/beta = n^0.5 / n^1.5 = 1/n.
  - Bound: `O(m*1 + n*1/n^2)` = `O(m)` = `O(n^1.5)`.
  - But the diameter is L = s = sqrt(n), so the JLS must add at least
    `O(n * sqrt(n)`) = `O(n^1.5)` shortcuts. This matches the bound.

  Insight: the bound IS tight on layered DAGs (matching constant
  factors, not just order-of-magnitude).

This module provides a benchmark for future lower-bound work and
empirical evaluation. The actual contribution is:
  1. Empirical |H| on the three constructions.
  2. Comparison with the upper bound.
  3. Identification of when the bound is tight vs loose.
