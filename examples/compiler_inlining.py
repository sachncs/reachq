"""Compiler inlining example.

Use reachq to identify which basic blocks should be inlined based
on their reachability within the IR. Blocks that many pivots reach
in a small hop count are good inlining candidates (they are
"upstream" of many code paths).

This example is a sketch, not a production compiler.
